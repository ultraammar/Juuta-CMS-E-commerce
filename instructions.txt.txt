-> Note: Created mostly as soloist without copypasting from Internet, by Ammar Waheed.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-> Place both the folders inside your www of XAMPP/WAMP.

-> This website is accessed through the juta-v1_ammar/index.php, even the Admin panel gets logged in through it.

-> The users table contains login details for only one Admin so far, called "AdminAmmar" which was created 
   and referred statically as Admin. More new admin creation is temporarily not included.

-> The users table can contain multiple registrations of users, and they can be used to login on the website.

-> Most of the stuff you see on the index.php is editable through the Admin panel, banners, shoes, updating the shoes, changing the weekly products, adding categories and so on. 

-> Validations are put into place to block wrong file input types instead of .jpgs

-> In case you're busy to look at the database table for login details of Admin, here:
   username: "AdminAmmar"
   password: "ammar"

-> For a user testing account, heres the login details.
   username: "ultraammar"
   password: "ammar"


-> I hope you like this Web Application as much as I did making it. ^_^
